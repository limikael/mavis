# mavis

Mavis is a robotic moving base that moves along a rail. It can host a variety of attachments (e.g. a robotic arm). It is an implementation used for [this project](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/post-scarcity-robotics-food). At the moment it is at an early stage, no documentation exists and things are in a general flux. Feel free to look around, however!

These are some photos of the first iteration that I built in Cambodia in 2017.

This is a rendering of the current prototype. As of writing I haven't started building it.
