1. Front
2. A robot to grows food.
  - It moves on a rail. The base of the design is a rail. The rail is created using 3D printed parts and PVC pipes. The rail is a rack rail.
  - On the rail thre is a moving base. This moving base has a cog wheel that engages the rack. The base has wheels on top and on the bottom the rail in order to not fall off.
  - The base has an arm on it. The arm can pivot and reach out on each side. At the tip of arm there is a tool mount for different tools.
3. Like a model train
  - The arm can reach 1.5m on each side.
  - The rail has straight as well as curve pieces.
  - Can be combined so a large area of any layout can be reached.
4. Farmbot (standing on the sholder of giants)
  - Mavis is built on the open source project Farmbot and can be thought of a mod or an extension and part of that ecosystem.
  - Mavis uses the Universal Tool Mount from Farmbot. It can use all the tools designed for Farmbot.
  - Mavis can be controlled using the Farmbot software. This is an app as well as a web based interface.
5. Cheap and available materials
  - Mechanical parts: PVC pipes and 3D printed designs.
  - Motors: Can be built with a variety of available motors. These can often be found as e-waste.
  - Electronics: Mavis uses Arduino and available of-the-shelf components.
6. Ideology. The why. 
7. The lego of robotics
   - There are 24 3D printable pieces.
   - Lige lego, these pieces can be played with and experimented with. What can you design?
   - This makes them a useful tool in STEM education.
8. Join.
  - This is an open source project.
  - Links to GitHub, Facebook

Like a model train.
It can be controlled via wifi.
